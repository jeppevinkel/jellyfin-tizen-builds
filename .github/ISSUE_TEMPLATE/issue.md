**Before posting**
Is this issue related to installing the wgt file or the contents of my repository?

Yes? Great, go on ahead and write your issue!
No? Then you might be in the wrong place.

For runtime issues, you are more likely to find great sources of help at either [jellyfin-tizen](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-tizen) or [jellyfin-web](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web) since those are the two places responsible for all the code in the client. jellyfin-web is the core client code, and jellyfin-tizen is the wrapper that makes it work on Samsung televisions.
